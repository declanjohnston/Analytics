Game importer created, needs to be run daily.
need to create game_analyzer which goes through every file for the day and appends each event to every involved players profile.
This might involve a lot of file opening, may be easier to use a server. Will have to test.
Same thing can be done for teams.
At this point we can compile statistics for players. Again this is more cleanly handled by a server with player objects.

As of right now there is no check on doubles. This will have to be corrected when reading the data.
Can be checked by looking at game id and event number.

Need to handle the case of a player being traded

Shifts easy to import from json, may consider moving everything to json, would be a lot of work but also would be nice to avoid csvs, all txt instead.
Shifts are shown for each individual player, would have to stitch together who was on during each event.
